# Dadaist

Dadaist is a tool for randomly generating short stories, perhaps for Twitter

"Why would one want such a thing?", I hear you ask. Well, some of *my* favourite
twitter accounts are actually scripts that generate random content. They might be
composed for reasons of creativity, humour or mystical reasons.

The inspiration for me writing this was to follow in their tracks. Early one Sunday
morning, I lay in a state of almost-sleep listening to the rain batter my West London home. The grey
and uninspiring dawn peeked through the curtain, so my mind moved to magical things,
specifically the writing of Jorge Luis Borges. I remembered his [Book of Imaginary Beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Imaginary_Beings) and started to create
and imagine beings of my own.

Something fired in my head, I got out of bed, and I started writing this code.

It does not have to be used for the creation of magical beasts as the examples will show.

All I ask is that whatever you use it for, it should be something that makes people feel good.
Make them feel entertained, make them laugh, make them inspired, make them warm and fuzzy inside.
Do not use this to cause hatred, division, to attack or to lie. Twitter has enough of that
already, it doesn't need you using this to do more.
